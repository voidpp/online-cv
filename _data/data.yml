career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      A Real Full Stack Developer, because I have electrical engineering background, 
      I learned developing softwares in the industry, I created high-load servers in C++, 
      web backends in Python, and single page application frontends in javascript/typescript. 
      And I am not scared of a psd file.

      There is a Clean Code phrase: write your code like the reviewer is a psychopath 
      who knows where are you live... or a less "violent" one: you are not writing the 
      code for the machine rather to an other human. Sure, the client pays for the feature, 
      but if we want to maintain that software, eg. adding new features or fixing bugs that 
      extra time what we used to create a good code will pay back the money. 
      That's how I feel about software development.
