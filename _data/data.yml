career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      A real Full Stack Developer, because I have electrical engineering background,
      I learned developing softwares in the industry, I created high-load servers in C++,
      web backends in Python, and single page application frontends in javascript/typescript.
      And I am not scared of a psd file also.

      There is a Clean Code expression: write your code like the reviewer is a psychopath
      who knows where you live... or a less "violent" one: you are not writing the
      code for the machine rather to another human. Sure, the client pays for the feature,
      but if we want to maintain that software in the future, eg. adding new features or
      fixing bugs the extra time spent on creating a good code will pay off.
      This is how I feel about software development.
